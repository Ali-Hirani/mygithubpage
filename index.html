<a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Me!</h3>

<p> <div align="justify"> My name is Ali Hirani and I am in my first year of Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo. I am strongly self-motivated in learning all things computing whether it's object oriented programming in <code>C#</code>, mobile app development for the Android platform with <code>Java</code> and <code>Android Studio</code>, Web development with <code>HTML</code> and <code>CSS</code> or the advanced use of various Linux distributions such as <code>CentOS</code>, <code>Ubuntu</code> and <code>OpenSUSE</code>.</div> </p>
<h3><a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Projects</h3>
<p> <div align="justify"> I strongly believe that these sorts of topics can be best learned through practice and independent developement. As a result, I put a team of amateur programmers, such as myself, together and decided to build a console application using the object oriented programming techniques we learned through a C# Fundamentals Course. </div> </p>

<p> <div align="justify"> We collaborated on the project through a Git repository service known as <code>GitHub</code>. The source code for the project can be found <a href="https://github.com/Ali-Hirani/proj-toolkit/blob/master/projToolkit.cs" class="user-mention">here</a>, and the application itself can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/Ali-Hirani/proj-toolkit/blob/master/projToolkit.exe">here</a>. </div> </p>

<p> <div align="justify"> Another project worth mentioning is a technical report I formatted using the document markup language known as LaTeX. It was an interesting experience, and I ended up learning the language because I felt as if I wanted something more powerful than Microsoft Word's equation tool for the formatting of calculations in the appendices. I was very satisfied with the end result, and our team won an award for best report writing against 20+ other groups. The screenshot below shows a sample of the calculations I wrote up (syntax vs published result). The entire report itself can be viewed <a href="resources/fuel-cell-cumulative-report.pdf">here</a>. </div> </p>

  <h3><a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Courseware</h3>

<p> <div align="justify"> In addition to learning by practice, I also enjoy learning somewhat independently through courseware, specifically through a website called edX. edX describes itself as "...offer(ing) interactive online classes and MOOCs from the worldâ€™s best universities." and houses courses from the likes of Harvard and MIT as well as top institutions from around the world such as Peking University and IIT Bombay. I would definitely reccomend <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-cs50x-introduction-computer-1022#.VBYn1vnimoF"><code>CS50</code></a>, offered by Harvard, and <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/linuxfoundationx/linuxfoundationx-lfs101x-introduction-1621#.VBYnZ_nimoE" class="user-mention"><code>Introduction to Linux</code></a>, offered by the Linux Foundation themselves (both of which I am currently enrolled in). </div> </p>

<a name="Livingston International - IT" class="anchor" href="#experience"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Livingston International - IT</h3>

<p> <div align="justify"> The story of my first real work experience begins in Fall of 2013, I was a first-year student with no prior job experience and I felt in over my head. I did however have a genuine knack for troubleshooting and I was always the go-to guy in my family for any PC related issues; I also happen to have built my own PC a few years prior. I ended up using these as talking points in my six IT interviews and landed a job at Livingston International as PC Support Specialist. That job title was misleading since I ended up supporting WYSE terminals, BlackBerry's, MFUs and a dozen other things. All in all it was an amazing experience, and the company had already been hiring coop students from the university for years. I soon found out that most of these past coop students were upper year students, and that despite my abilities in personal troubleshooting, this job wasn't very straightforward (see resume for the type of work I did). The first few weeks was non-stop learning and applying, I was the new guy. By the end, I was managing the ticket queue as team captain, a privilege normally give to coops for a single week towards the end of the term. I felt so confident in holding the role that I requested an extension on my week to a month. During that time, the ever consistent flow of tickets was drastically mitigated and the queue went from 250 tickets to 150 on my watch. Many of these tickets were wrongly assigned in the first place and it was largely a matter of someone taking the initiative to go through each ticket and reassign and close them as needed. That someone was me. It was then I realized that the single most important thing I needed to do for my future co-op jobs was to make an impact and leave my mark. </div> </p>
